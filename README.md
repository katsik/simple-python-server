# simple-python-server
A simple python server with a basic GET and POST functionality.

# Pre-Requisites
In order to run this project succesfully you need to download the sqlalchemy library first. You can download it from the [official sqlalchemy page](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html) . I used the 1.1.14 version which was the current release at the time of the development.

Apart from the sqlalchemy library you won't need anything else to make the project run. However, what I did was create a database with some objects so that I can have some basic CRUD functionality for this project.

# One More Thing
First you have to run the database_setup.py file for the database to be created. Once you run it without any problems, I encourage you to add some objects to your database. However the server will be up and running without having any objects in your database.
